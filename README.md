- **Structure of a clock:**
- A clock is composed of 360 degrees and divided into 12 equal divisions. The angle between the consecutive divisions is obtained by dividing the total angle of clock 360° by the number of divisions i.e. 12.

- **The angle between any two consecutive divisions = (360°)/12= 30°**
- Angular value of a minute = (30°)/5= 6°
- **So, rotating degrees are :**
-> hRotation = 30*hh + mm/2;
-> let mRotation = 6*mm;
-> let sRotation = 6*ss;
